# Software Project Course - Sem B 2024
## Project Overview
This is our final project in the **Software Project course** at **Tel Aviv University**.  
We implemented a clustering algorithm based on **Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization** (SymNMF).  

## Features
- Efficient implementation of **SymNMF** using the **Python/C API** for performance critical calculations.
- A comparative analysis between **SymNMF** and **KMeans** clustering on a given dataset.
- Modular and readable code structure and design for ease of understanding and extensibility.

## Technologies
- Python3
- C
- Numpy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
